Some of the warnings couldn't be removed because Xcode tries to meet constraints that are impossible for older iPhones in landscape mode.

The app runs on all iPhone, iPod touch and iPad devices that support the minimum iOS version, except from 3.5 iPhones, because the interface wasn't good even in portrait mode.

Setting up the interface to work on both iPhone and iPad in both landscape and portrait mode was harder than I expected. It took much more time and this is one of the main reasons, in my opinion, why other expenses apps support only iPhones in portrait mode.

Adding the category icons and make them scroll was something that I was really proud. I did it in a intuitive way, putting the icons inside stack views to put into a scroll view. And Joe even said that not many people get this insight at the first time.

Unfortunately, it don't have unit tests. I am aware of their importance, but I didn't create a methods that could have a unit test. My project is incomplete and when I added more meaningful methods, unit test would be added.

I used git following the best practices. It was really helpful, specially when I had to revert a commit.
